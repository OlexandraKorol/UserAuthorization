## Technologies Used

- **React Native:** A framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- **MobX:** A library for efficient state management in React applications.
- **React Navigation:** A routing and navigation library for React Native applications.

## Getting Started Locally with React Native

## Step 0: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git@github.com:OlexandraKorol/RNAuthorization.git
   ```

   or

   ```
   https://github.com/OlexandraKorol/RNAuthorization.git
   ```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
